## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist interested in brain waves and their role in different cognitive processes. I'm also trying to apply this basic research approach to improving accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis in disorders of consciousness like coma or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome. 
I'm currently based at the Research Center for Mind, Brain and Behavior (CIMCYC) at the University of Granada in Spain as a RamÃ³n y Cajal Fellow.
